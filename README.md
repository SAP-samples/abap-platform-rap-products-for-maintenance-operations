# SAP Build Extensibility Scenario
# Retrieve Products for Maintenance Task List Operations

## Overview

This usecase aims to support technicians and on-site operators in retrieving the list of products assigned to a maintenance operations of a task list.
In particular, the scenario covers the definition of custom CDS-views, the creation of a corresponding UI service and - finally - the build of a lean Fiori application to visualize the data.

The scenario was created to showcase how to enhance the functionalities offered by SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition following the so called "_Developer/On-Stack_" extensibility model. 
The technical artefacts have been developed using the ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model (RAP) and SAP Fiori tools for the UI, leveraging the ABAP stack offered by SAP S/4HANA as the development platform.

Using such a custom-developed app, a user get access to the list of products involved in the maintenance operations and sub-operations.


> [!Note]
  > - In this sample, data are retrieved from an SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition.

### Key Features
- Facilitates the identification of products involved in maintenance operations.
- Extends the functionalities of SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition, maintaining the core clean.
- Access to live data from SAP S/4HANA leveraging standard CDS views like [_I_MAINTTASKLISTOPMATERIAL_](https://api.sap.com/search?searchterm=I_MAINTTASKLISTOPMATERIAL&tab=All&$refinedBy=true).


## Prerequisites

### Setup of the development environment - Eclipse and SAP ADT
Download and install the Eclipse IDE and the ABAP Development Tools (ADT) plugin; a complete step-by-step guide covering the process is available [here](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/abap-install-adt..html)

### Installation of abapGit
Install the abapGit plugin as explained [here](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/abap-install-abapgit-plugin..html).


## Content Download and Installation 

The following paragraphs explain how the delivered content can be download, deployed and enabled in your development environment.
The content can be cloned directly from this Git repository as briefly explained in paragraph :one:. 
To complete the setup of this scenario, please follow the instructions carefully.

> [!Note]
> To setup this scenario, we assume a basic technical knowledge of SAP ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model (RAP).
> A detailed explanation of the definition, the purpose and the deployment of the various artefacts is the out of scope for this document.
